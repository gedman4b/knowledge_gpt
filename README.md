## Installation

Follow the instructions below to run the Streamlit server locally.

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have Python ≥3.10 installed.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmz-001/knowledge_gpt
cd knowledge_gpt
```

2. Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and activate virtual environment

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

3. (Optional) Avoid adding the OpenAI API every time you run the server by adding it to environment variables.
   - Make a copy of `.env.example` named `.env`
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file

> **Note:** Make sure you have a paid OpenAI API key for faster completions and to avoid hitting rate limits.

4. Run the Streamlit server

```bash
cd knowledge_gpt
streamlit run main.py
```

## Build with Docker

Run the following commands to build and run the Docker image.

```bash
cd knowledge_gpt
docker build -t knowledge_gpt .
docker run -p 8501:8501 knowledge_gpt
docker container ls
docker stop adoring_mccarthy
```

Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser to access the app.

## Customization

You can increase the max upload file size by changing `maxUploadSize` in `.streamlit/config.toml`.
Currently, the max upload size is 25MB for the hosted version.
